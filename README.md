 Time and attendance systems are used to track and monitor when employees start and stop work. 
 A time and attendance system enables an employer to monitor their employees working hours and late arrivals, 
 early departures, time taken on breaks and absenteeism. It also helps to control labor costs by reducing over-payments,
 which are often caused by paying employees for time that are not working,and eliminates transcription error, interpretation error and intentional error.
